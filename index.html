      <h2><em>Welcome To The 4YP</em></h2>
      <p><i>My name is Realeboha Mofube, I have 21 years of age. I was born and raised in Leribe, Hlotse. I studied my preschool, primary and partially high school. From there I moved to Maseru district, And I completed my highschool at Maseru Private Academy in 2021.</i></p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p><i>Growing up, I always had interest in gadgets and tech related stuff. So the next year after I completed highschool, I enrolled into Limkokwing University of creative Technology majoring in Business IT. I thought this would be the beggining of a life changing journey, indeed it was but not how I had actually expected. Everything was going okay for the first semester at time went we got introduced to a module called Calculus which for the first time we failed as the whole class, but we were given a second chance and some made it but me and a few others didnt make it still. That is where the 4YP(4 year plan) startted, i kept on trying but kept failing this module because of silly careless mistakes. Eventually I started losing hope, hanging with bad friends, and making bad descions and my grades reflected it. Until I decided it was enough! I had to seek help, but first I figured the first step should be a chamge in senerio. Had to go back to the drawing board and restrategize. Thats when I found out about Holberton school on facebook and I started doing my research about the school and even organized a meeting with one of the lectures there who told me all about the school and I just kept falling in love with the school.<mark>I am a hard working individual with a vision of utalizing Technology to create jobs for the youth of my country or atleast openening their minds about the struggles of school, friends and temptations.<b>I DO NOT RGRET MY MISTAKES AND FALL BACKS FOR I USE THEM TO TEACH OTHERS. MY MISTAKES ARE LESSONS THAT SHAPED ME, TURNING WHAT ONCE FELT LIKE WASTED TIME INTO THE FOUNDATION OF A BETTER LIFE.</b></mark> </i></p>

      <h3>Quote</h3>
      <p><i>"The road was brutal, the nights were long, and the doubts were louder than hopeâ€”but I kept walking, and that made all the difference."
        This quote captures the essence of resilience. Life's journey is rarely smoothâ€”there are moments of failure, fear, and exhaustion. But what defines a person's character is not how easy the path was, but the decision to keep moving forward despite everything. The quote emphasizes persistence: even when hope is faint and the struggle feels endless, continuing to moveâ€”even slowlyâ€”builds strength, endurance, and ultimately leads to growth. It's a reminder that perseverance, not perfection, leads to transformation.

To echo this, consider what Denzel Washington once said:
<mark>"Fall forward. Every failed experiment is one step closer to success."
His words reinforce the idea that setbacks are not the endâ€”theyâ€™re part of the journey toward achieving something greater.</mark>
